                <h1 class="font-semibold text-base mt-10">Tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem, or trunk,
                    usually supporting branches and leaves. In some usages, the definition of a tree may be narrower,
                    including only wood plants with secondary growth, plants that are usable as lumber or plants above a
                    specified height. In wider definitions, the taller palms, tree ferns, bananas, and bamboos are also
                    trees. Trees are not a taxonomic group but include a variety of plant species that have
                    independently evolved a trunk and branches as a way to tower above other plants to compete for
                    sunlight. The majority of tree species are angiosperms or hardwoods; of the rest, many are
                    gymnosperms or softwoods. Trees tend to be long-lived, some reaching several thousand years old.
                    Trees have been in existence for 370 million years. It is estimated that there are some three
                    trillion mature trees in the world.A tree typically has many secondary branches supported clear of
                    the ground by the trunk. This trunk typically contains woody tissue for strength, and vascular
                    tissue to carry materials from one part of the tree to another. For most trees it is surrounded by a
                    layer of bark which serves as a protective barrier. Below the ground, the roots branch and spread
                    out widely; they serve to anchor the tree and extract moisture and nutrients from the soil..</h1>
